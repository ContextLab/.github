Hey there, and welcome to our GitHub landing page 👋!

The [Contextual Dynamics Lab](https://github.com/ContextLab) at [Dartmouth College](https://www.dartmouth.edu) 🌲 is a motley crew of science nerds 🤓 united in the pursuit of understanding the inner workings and limits of human memory 🧠. We build tools 🧰, design models 🤖, teach open courses 🧑‍🏫, write papers 📚, give talks 🗣️, share data 💾, and do various other data sciencey things 💻.
